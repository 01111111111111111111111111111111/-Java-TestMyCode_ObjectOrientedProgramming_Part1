        //"The program output should resemble the following:
        //"Jane Doe"

        //Use of the System command to output the print of string my name
        //(" "); to make Michael Wang the string/text that print out
        //Big picture and flow: compile --> Name.java (name of original source code file) --> bytecode --> interpreter
        //The semicolon ";" ends the command and in the case of another line or diff commands, it separates them.
        //That's good for the compiler to understand, but for humans to understand as well...need LINE BREAKS to properly read code.
        //System.out.print prints the text without the line break at the end; single lined

        System.out.println("Jane Doe");
